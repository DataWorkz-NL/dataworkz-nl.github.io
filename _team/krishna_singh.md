* **Thinking fast and slow**: A profound, rich and surprising book that brought me a better understanding of the world and how our minds work. This book enriches my understanding aboutÂ our everyday reasoning and decision making abilities.
* **Black notebook**: I grew up fascinated by the way my father used notebooks for taking notes and planning. Nowadays, I find note-taking as a very useful habit in tracking tasks, goal planning and capturing the thoughts in ink.
* **GPS watch**: One of my favourite accessory. It helps me explore places and tells whether I am doing it fast enough.
* **Running shoes**: Most vital companion of my running journey. We explore new terrains and go running together!
* **Python book**: Curiosity brought me closer to this book and helped take 1st step towards an interesting learning.
